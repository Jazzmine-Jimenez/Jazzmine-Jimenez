### Hi there, welcome to my GitHub ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ˜„ A little about me: 
I was introduced to coding about 8 years ago and immediately fell in love.

I have a B.S. in mathematics because I love how difficult math is, the problem solving, the logic and how accomplished I feel when I complete a problem. I was able to find everything I love about math in coding, but the big difference you are able to create something that others can use.

After taking that C++ course I considered switching majors but being a first generation college student decided it was more important for me to complete my degree in 4 years.

Looking back now I wish I would have taken the extra time, but here I am in the middle of a career change as recent coding bootcamp grad making my dream of coding for a living a reality.
